3. Board Specific Patches
=========================
To get a list of patches applied to the kernel specific to this BSP,
along with patch descriptions, use git to see what changed on the default
kernel (git whatchanged <kernel_type>..<bsp_name>). For example:

	# cd tmp-glibc/work-shared/nxp-imx9/kernel-source
	# git whatchanged standard/base..


4. Boot Instructions
====================

4.1 NFS Root File System
------------------------

4.1.1 Prepare Kernel, DTB, NFS and TFTP servers
-----------------------------------------------
The files in the following example can be found in <buildprj>/tmp-glibc/deploy/images/nxp-imx9
and are copied to the export directory of the TFTP server.

4.1.2 Download kernel
---------------------

	# tftp $kernel_addr Image

4.1.3 Download DTB
------------------
There is a default dtb to support for the most of features for MCIMX93-EVK board.
Besides the default dtb, there are also other dtb files to support for some specific
features, sub-boards and accessory used to extend features. Detailed list as below:

	Default dtb:
	tftp $fdt_addr imx93-11x11-evk.dtb

	If user wants to connect LVDS panel:
	tftp $fdt_addr imx93-11x11-evk-boe-wxga-lvds-panel.dtb

	If user wants to enable lpspi master:
	tftp $fdt_addr imx93-11x11-evk-lpspi.dtb

	If user wants to enable i3c:
	tftp $fdt_addr imx93-11x11-evk-i3c.dtb

	If user wants to connect MX93AUD-HAT sub-board:
	tftp $fdt_addr imx93-11x11-evk-aud-hat.dtb

	If user wants to enable MQS(Medium quality sound):
	tftp $fdt_addr imx93-11x11-evk-mqs.dtb

	If user wants to enable flexspi:
	tftp $fdt_addr imx93-11x11-evk-flexspi-m2.dtb

	If user wants to enable lpuart:
	tftp $fdt_addr imx93-11x11-evk-lpuart.dtb

4.1.5 Set bootargs and boot the system
--------------------------------------

	# setenv bootargs console=<$console_port> root=/dev/nfs rw \
		 nfsroot=<nfs server>:<nfs root> \
		 ip=<target IP>::<gateway>:<netmask>::eth0:off \
		 video=HDMI-A-1:1920x1080-32@60
	# booti $kernel_addr - $fdt_addr

Note: for MCIMX93-EVK board, $kernel_addr="0x80400000", $fdt_addr="0x83000000"
	$console_port = "ttyLP0,115200"
      The kernel image will become larger if more kernel code is compiled into kernel image.
      So, please increase "fdt_addr" value by putting dtb file at higher address if you encounter with kernel booting failed.


5. Features
===========

5.1 HDMI
--------

To enable HDMI as the default framebuffer device, add:

	video=HDMI-A-1:1920x1080-32@60

to the bootargs parameter of U-Boot.

5.2 USB feature
---------------

5.2.1 USB OTG device mode
-------------------------

Connect USB1(J401) to host PC with a usb cable, one end is type-A, another end is type-C.
And run below command to make the target working as USB disk.

		# modprobe g_mass_storage file=/dev/mmcblk1p1 stall=0 removable=1

After the g_mass_storage driver module is loaded normally, there will be an usb disk detected by host PC.

5.2.2 USB OTG host mode
-----------------------

After system boots up, if user connects an usb disk with usb type-C USB1 port(J401) or USB2(J302) on MCIMX93-EVK board,
The usb disk will be detected, and then confirm the speed with command as below:

	# lsusb -t
	/:  Bus 01.Port 1: Dev 1, Class=root_hub, Driver=ci_hdrc/1p, 480M
	    |__ Port 1: Dev 2, If 0, Class=Mass Storage, Driver=usb-storage, 480M

5.3 Static Power Management
---------------------------

The debug UART can be set as a wakeup source with:

Enter suspend status with below command:
	# echo enabled > /sys/class/tty/ttyLP0/power/wakeup
	# echo mem > /sys/power/state

Click any key of keyboard to resume system.

5.4 Graphics
------------

5.4.1 Xwayland
--------------
If you want to build a xwayland image, please follow the steps as below:

<1> Setup program and create a build directory by using the following arguments:

	--machines nxp-imx9 --distros wrlinux-graphics --dl-layers

<2> Setup environment and create a build directory:

	$ . ./environment-setup-<host>-wrlinuxsdk-linux
	$ . ./oe-init-build-env <build>

<3> Use the command as below to build a xwayland image:

	bitbake wrlinux-image-std-sato

5.5 thermal
-----------

	To check current CPU temperature
	# cd /sys/class/thermal/thermal_zone0
	# cat temp
	51000
	# cat trip_point_0_type
	passive
	# cat trip_point_0_temp
	80000
	# cat trip_point_1_type
	critical
	# cat trip_point_1_temp
	90000

5.6 Optee-test
--------------

Because optee os is integrated into the bootloader image, and due to license reasons,
we don't support building the bootloader by default. Therefore, before using optee
features, you need to refer to README.proprietary ("Build imx-boot") to compile an WIC image
with the bootloader.

1) Burn WIC image
# bitbake wrlinux-image-std
# dd if=wrlinux-image-<std-sato/std>-nxp-imx8.wic of=/dev/your_sd_dev

5.8 FLEXCAN
-----------

Detail verification commands as below:

Currently, imx93 J1101 is a can interface, 1-4 are 5V, CAN_H, CAN_L, and GND
respectively. Please use a board that supports canfd function to connect, such as imx8qm-mek.

Run below commands on imx93-evk board:
	 # ip link set can0 up type can bitrate 500000 dbitrate 8000000 fd on
	 # candump can0 &
	 # ip -d -s link show can0

Run below commands on imx8qm-mek:
	 # ip link set can1 up type can bitrate 500000 dbitrate 8000000 fd on
	 # cansend can1 5A1#11.22.33.44.55.66.77.88
	 # ip -d -s link show can1

If can0 dumps data from can1, FLEXCAN feature works fine.

5.9 camera
----------

1) Download the "ap1302_60fps_ar0144_27M_2Lane_awb_tuning.bin" file from
https://github.com/ONSemiconductor/ap1302_binaries/tree/main/NXP_i.MX93

2) Rename it to "ap1302.fw"

3) After booting the Linux OS, copy the file to the target board under "/lib/firmware/imx/camera" and reboot.

4) After system boots up again, run below command to preview video on screen

	 # gst-launch-1.0 -v v4l2src device=/dev/video0 ! "video/x-raw,format=YUY2,width=1280,height=800" ! queue ! waylandsink

Note: In order to preview video on screen, user needs to build wrlinux-image-std-sato image

5.10 Low Drive Mode
-------------------

The Linux kernel configures the system to run in Overdrive mode (ODM) by default.
This Overdrive mode and associated performance are not necessary for some user
applications. Users can transition to Nominal or Low-drive mode as defined in
the i.MX 93 data sheet instead.

You can switch to Low Drive Mode with below command:

echo 1 > /sys/devices/platform/imx93-lpm/mode
System switching to ND mode...

cat /sys/devices/platform/imx93-lpm/mode


6. kexec/kdump
==============

For discussion purposes, some useful terminology will be described here.

* boot kernel - the first kernel that you start and supports kexec, from U-Boot
	      for instance
* capture kernel - the kernel that you reboot into after a boot kernel crash

To build the boot kernel, enable kexec and kdump in your local.conf file:

	WRTEMPLATE = "feature/kexec feature/kdump"

6. kexec
--------

After system boots up, copy Image to the rootfs, and run below command:

	 # vim kexec.arg
	 Add below content into file, and then save it
	 console=ttyLP0,115200 earlycon no_console_suspend root=/dev/nfs rw nfsroot=<host ip>:<rootfs path>,v3,tcp ip=dhcp
	 # kexec -l /root/Image --append="$(<kexec.args)"
	 # kexec -e

6.2 kdump
---------

In order to run the kdump feature, it needs to reserve a memory region for the capture kernel.
So user needs to add below parameter into bootargs when booting up the boot kernel image.

    crashkernel=512M

After system boots up, copy Image to the rootfs, and run below command:

	 # vim kdump.arg
	 Add below content into file, and then save it
	 console=ttyLP0,115200 earlycon no_console_suspend root=/dev/nfs rw nfsroot=<host ip>:<rootfs path>,v3,tcp ip=dhcp maxcpus=1
	 # kexec -p /root/Image --append="$(<kdump.args)"
	 # echo c > /proc/sysrq-trigger

Note:
- Before booting the dump-capture kernel, add "maxcpus=1 cma=128M" to the boot parameter.
- Use Image as a secondary kernel. It can be found in the tmp-glibc/deploy/images/nxp-imx9/ directory.

For more detailed info about kdump, refer to Documentation/kdump/kdump.txt
in the kernel source tree.

7. Creating Partitioned Images(WIC)
===================================

User can use the OpenEmbedded Image Creator, wic, to create the properly
partitioned image on a SD card. The wic command
generates partitioned images from existing OpenEmbedded build artifacts.
User can refer to the below URL to get more WIC details:

https://docs.yoctoproject.org/singleindex.html#creating-partitioned-images-using-wic

This BSP supports disk images for SD card.
After build the project, user will get a WIC image under the directory
tmp/deploy/images/<bsp name>/ ,such as:

tmp-glibc/deploy/images/nxp-imx9/wrlinux-image-<std-sato/std>-nxp-imx9.wic

Then user can write the output image to a SD card.

7.1 Burn images to SD card
--------------------------

1) Burn WIC image

# dd if=wrlinux-image-<std-sato/std>-nxp-imx9.wic of=/dev/your_sd_dev

2) Set environment variable for booting system

For MCIMX93-EVK board:

u-boot=>setenv fdt_file imx93-11x11-evk.dtb
u-boot=>setenv bootfile Image
u-boot=>setenv bootargs 'root=/dev/mmcblk1p2 rw rootdelay=5 console=${console},${baudrate} earlycon ip=dhcp'
u-boot=>setenv bootcmd 'fatload mmc 1:1 $loadaddr $bootfile; fatload mmc 1:1 $fdt_addr $fdt_file; booti $loadaddr - $fdt_addr';
u-boot=>run bootcmd
